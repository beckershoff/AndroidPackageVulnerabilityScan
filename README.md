Android Vulnerability Check

This Python script allows you to check for vulnerabilities in a list of Android applications using the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API. The script utilizes the NVD API to retrieve vulnerability information for each app in the list and provides a report of any identified vulnerabilities.
Features

    Easy-to-use script for checking Android app vulnerabilities
    Utilizes the NIST NVD API for retrieving vulnerability data
    Error handling to handle API rate limits and connection issues
    Progress bar to track the progress of the vulnerability check
    Estimated time of completion (ETA) displayed during the check
    Supports both public and API key-based access to the NVD API

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    requests library (can be installed via pip install requests)

Usage

    Obtain an API key from the NIST NVD API website (optional but recommended for higher rate limits).
    Update the API_KEY variable in the script with your API key.
    Prepare a list of Android app package names to check for vulnerabilities and store them in a text file (one package name per line).
    Run the script using the command python AndroidVulnerabilityCheck.py -f <file_path> where <file_path> is the path to the text file containing the package names.

Limitations

    The script is limited by the rate limits imposed by the NVD API. Public access allows 5 requests in a rolling 30-second window, while API key-based access allows 50 requests in the same window.
    For large lists of apps, the script may take some time to complete the vulnerability check.
